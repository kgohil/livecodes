# Docker Setup

LiveCodes is a [client-side app](../why.mdx#client-side). It can be easily self-hosted on any static file server or CDN (See [Self-Hosting guide](../features/self-hosting.mdx)).

LiveCodes core functionalities (e.g. editors, compilers, formatters, code execution, etc) run in the browser. However, some features require [external services](./services.mdx) which depend on server-side implementations.
This docker setup provides an easy out-of-the-box implementations for self-hosting these services.

## Example

This is an example of a self-hosted deployment, that was deployed to a VPS using the included docker setup:

https://vps.livecodes.io/

This is the command used to build and run the app:

```sh
HOST_NAME=vps.livecodes.io docker compose up --build -d
```

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git (optional): for pulling updates.

Install Git, Docker and Docker Compose on Ubuntu
</summary>

This script installs git, docker, and docker compose on Ubuntu:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install Git
sudo apt install -y git

# Install Docker
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Add current user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker # Apply group changes immediately

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

To use this script:

**Save**

Save the script to a file, for example: `install_docker_ubuntu.sh`.

**Make Executable**

Make the script executable with:

```sh
chmod +x install_docker_ubuntu.sh
```

**Run**

Execute the script using:
```sh
sudo ./install_docker_ubuntu.sh
```

It's recommended to run it with `sudo` to ensure all necessary permissions are granted.

**Verify**

Verify the installations with:

```sh
git --version
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes.git
```

Enter the directory:

```sh
cd livecodes
```

Optionally, checkout a specific branch:

```sh
git checkout main
```

Run docker compose:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

By default, the app is served at https://livecodes.localhost

The hostname and many other options can be set using [environment variables](#environment-variables).

## Features

- Automatic HTTPS

  This is provided by [Caddy server](https://caddyserver.com), which automatically obtains and renews TLS certificates.
  Local addresses (e.g. `localhost`, `livecodes.localhost`) are served over HTTPS using locally-trusted certificates.

- [Open Graph meta tags](https://ogp.me/)

  Provide project-specific meta tags, that show projects title and description on social media cards.

- [oEmbed](https://oembed.com/)

  Allows embedded representations on third party sites.

- [Short-URL share service](../features/share.mdx)

  Generates a short URL that can be shared. The project config is stored in a [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) store (a Redis fork with a permissive open-source license).
  Data is persisted to disk every 60 seconds (See [Volumes](#volumes) section below).

- [Broadcast server](../features/broadcast.mdx)

  Broadcasts updates to connected clients.

- CORS proxy

  Allows [importing content](../features/import.mdx) from external URLs.

- Separate origin sandbox

  Runs code in a separate origin [sandboxed iframe](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/) to prevent cross-site scripting.


## Environment Variables

The app can be customized by setting different environment variables.


Environment variables can be defined in the `.env` file in the root of the repository (on the same level as `docker-compose.yml`).

```txt title=".env"
HOST_NAME=playground.website.com
```

Please note that some variables are used **during build**. So after setting environment variables, the app needs to be rebuilt. e.g.:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

The following environment variables are supported:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HOST_NAME` | Hostname of the app | `livecodes.localhost` |
| `PORT` | Port of the app | `443` |
| `SELF_HOSTED_SHARE` | Enable [share service](../features/share.mdx) | `true` |
| `SELF_HOSTED_BROADCAST` | Enable [broadcast server](../features/broadcast.mdx) | `true` |
| `BROADCAST_PORT` | Port of the broadcast server | `3030` |
| `BROADCAST_TOKENS` | Comma-separated list of broadcast [user tokens](../features/broadcast.mdx#technical-details) | |
| `SANDBOX_HOST_NAME` | Hostname of the sandbox | `$HOST_NAME` |
| `SANDBOX_PORT` | Port of the sandbox | `8090` |
| `FIREBASE_CONFIG` | [Firebase config object](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object) (JSON), used for [authentication](../features/github-integration.mdx) | |
| `DOCS_BASE_URL` | [Base URL](../features/self-hosting.mdx#custom-build) of the documentation | `null` |
| `LOG_URL` | URL to send server-side analytics | `null` |

## Volumes

The following directories are mounted as volumes:

- `/data` - Persistent data is stored here (e.g. for Valkey and Caddy). Make sure to **backup** this.
- `/assets` - Static assets saved here are served on the app URL (`/assets/`). This can be used to serve images, stylesheets, [custom modules](../features/module-resolution.mdx#custom-module-resolution), [custom types](../features/intellisense.mdx#custom-types), etc.
